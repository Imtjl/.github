## IMTJL - It's More Than Just Labs

Welcome to the `IMTJL` organization on GitHub! This is a collaborative platform for students interested in software engineering, mathematics, 
and other related topics. Here, you will find repositories for laboratory works, lecture notes, scripts, and bots designed to automate some of the tasks.

Our organization includes members with diverse backgrounds and expertise, working with various programming languages, such as Kotlin, JavaScript, Java, 
Ruby, Python, assembly, TypeScript and others. We believe that this variety of skills and interests will help us to create valuable and innovative projects
that can benefit the community.

### Repositories:

In our organization, you will find a growing number of repositories, each with its own purpose and contents. Here are some of the main ones:

    Java_labs: this repository contains all java laboratory works completed by the members of our organization, organized by number and difficulty level.

    Higher_Mathematics: this repository contains lecture and practises notes, homeworks, and other materials created by our members to help each 
    other study and learn.

    scripts: this repository contains useful scripts and bots that automate repetitive or tedious tasks related to linear algebra and other subjects.

    tutorials: this repository contains step-by-step guides, tutorials, and walkthroughs that help members learn new skills and concepts.

We encourage all members to contribute to these repositories and to create new ones if needed. 
If you have an idea for a new project or want to collaborate with someone, feel free to start a discussion on the corresponding 
repository's Issues page or on our general chat. If you want to join our team - contact via our offical email, ot write to our owner via telegram.

### Communication

We believe that communication is key to successful collaboration. That's why we have several channels for communication within our organization:

    general chat: this is a public chat room where members can discuss anything related to the organization, ask questions, or just chat.

    repositories: each repository has its own Issues page, where members can report bugs, suggest improvements, or ask questions related to that specific project.

    direct messages: members can also send direct messages to each other for private discussions or collaboration.
