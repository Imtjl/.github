## Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the `Imtjl` organization on GitHub! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our community.   
### Getting Started
1. First, make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't, you can [sign up here](https://github.com/join).
2. Fork the repository you want to explore or contribute to.   
└ [How to fork repository](https://github.com/Imtjl/GitHub-Tutorials/)   
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; └ [Why do you need to fork repo before cloning](https://github.com/Imtjl/GitHub-Tutorials/)
3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.  
└ [How to clone repository](https://github.com/Imtjl/GitHub-Tutorials/)   
4. Create a new branch for your changes.  
└ [How to set up a new branch](https://github.com/Imtjl/GitHub-Tutorials/) 

### Making Changes
```python
1. Make your changes in the new branch you created.
2. Test your changes thoroughly.
3. Commit your changes and write a clear and concise commit message.
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
```

### Commit messages

We use somewhat beautiful :sparkles: and outstanding :rocket: notation for commits!
It would be familiar for those, who used conventional commits.

Commit message should be in the following format:

```
type[!] message
```

That is `type` optionally followed by exclamation mark, strictly followed by ***one*** space, followed by a message. 

Total message length may exceed 80 characters (type is counted as one character), but it is recommended to make messages expressive and small.

Exclamation mark denotes breaking change. It is correlates with [`MAJOR`](https://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning. 

Type should be one of the following:

- :sparkles:
(`:sparkles:`) indicates new feature (analogue to `feat` tag in conventional commits)

- :wrench:
(`:wrench:`) improve or fix something (like somethis in between `refactor` and `fix` in conventional commits). Can be used interchangeably with :bug: (`:bug:`)


- :bug:
 (`:bug:`) Indicates bug fix! More like `fix` in conventional commits

- :books:
 (`:books:`) Denotes work on documentation (analogue is `doc` from conventional commits)

- :hammer:
 (`:hammer:`) General refactoring. Directory moves/additions/removals, project structure changes, work from ground up are all fall under this type

- :recycle:
  (`:recycle:`) same as :hammer: (`:hammer:`)

- :rocket:
 (`:rocket:`) Starting new great things (like new repository or subproject)!

- :wastebasket:
(`:wastebasket:`)
 removing trash from repository like obsolete files

#### Examples

:bug: do not request auth token twice

:sparkles: introduce commit message standard

:books: document *that one* class

:recycle: rework request handler

### Submitting Changes
```python
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request.
2. Describe your changes and why they are necessary in the pull request.
3. Wait for a member of the IMTJL organization to review your pull request.
```
